      "When I started learning React, everything felt confusing — components, hooks, props, and state. Instead of watching more tutorials, I decided to build a small project. That decision changed everything.\n\nI began with a simple layout and slowly added features like routing and state management. Making mistakes helped me understand why things work the way they do. This project taught me that building projects is the fastest way to truly learn React."

      "useEffect confused me for a long time. The turning point was when I stopped memorizing rules and started thinking in terms of side effects.\n\nuseEffect runs after the component renders and is useful for tasks like fetching data, updating localStorage, or adding event listeners. Once I understood this mental model, useEffect stopped being scary."

      "Before learning React, I struggled because my JavaScript basics were weak. Concepts like closures, promises, and array methods are used everywhere in modern frameworks.\n\nAfter revisiting JavaScript fundamentals, React felt much easier. Frameworks change, but strong fundamentals stay valuable forever."
